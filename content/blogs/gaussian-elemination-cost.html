<h2>What is Gaussian Elimination?</h2>

<p><strong>Gaussian Elimination</strong> is a method used to solve systems of linear equations. It systematically eliminates variables to reduce the system into an upper triangular form, followed by back-substitution to find the unknowns.</p>
<p>Essentially, it answers: <em>“How can we convert any system of equations into a simpler one that’s easy to solve?”</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Analyze Its Cost?</h2>

<p>When solving large systems (with <code>n</code> equations and <code>n</code> unknowns), we usually let computers perform the elimination. But before running the algorithm, it’s crucial to know how much <strong>computational effort</strong> it will take.</p>

<p>In Gaussian Elimination, the main question is:</p>
<blockquote>“How many arithmetic operations (additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions) are needed?”</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Types of Operations</h2>

<p>During elimination, two main types of operations occur:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Division</strong> → To find the multiplier <code>λ</code> (pivot ratio).</li>
    <li><strong>Multiply–Subtract</strong> → To eliminate elements below the pivot (each considered one operation).</li>
</ol>
<p>So every time we zero out an element below the pivot, we perform a <strong>division</strong> and several <strong>multiply–subtracts</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step-by-Step Cost Analysis</h2>

<h3>First Column</h3>
<p>We eliminate elements below the first pivot.</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are <code>(n − 1)</code> rows below it.</li>
    <li>For each row, roughly <code>n</code> operations are needed (to modify entries along that row).</li>
</ul>
<p>Total ≈ <code>n(n − 1) = n² − n</code> operations.</p>

<h3>Next Columns</h3>
<p>In the next steps, the system gets smaller:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When only <code>k</code> equations remain, the cost per stage is roughly <code>k² − k</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find the total cost, we sum over all stages:</p>

<pre><code>Σ (k² − k) from k=1 to n
= (1² + 2² + … + n²) − (1 + 2 + … + n)
= (1/3)(n³ − n)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Total Forward Elimination Cost</h2>

<p>Hence, <strong>Forward Elimination</strong> requires approximately:</p>
<pre><code>(1/3)(n³ − n) ≈ (1/3)n³</code></pre>

<p>That’s <strong>O(n³)</strong> complexity.</p>
<p>If you double the size (<code>n → 2n</code>), the cost increases roughly <strong>8×</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Back-Substitution Cost</h2>

<p>Once the matrix is in upper-triangular form:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The last variable needs <strong>1 operation</strong>.</li>
    <li>The second-last needs <strong>2 operations</strong>, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total:</p>
<pre><code>1 + 2 + 3 + … + n = (n(n+1))/2 ≈ (1/2)n²</code></pre>
<p>That’s much faster — <strong>O(n²)</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Right-Hand Side (RHS) Operations</h2>

<p>The right-hand side (the constants of each equation) also gets updated during elimination, adding roughly:</p>
<pre><code>n²</code></pre>
<p>operations in total — still smaller than the cubic cost of elimination.</p>

<h2>Can It Be Faster?</h2>

<p>Originally, mathematicians believed that no method could beat <code>(n³ / 3)</code> operations. But the <strong>Strassen’s algorithm</strong> surprised everyone by multiplying matrices using only <strong>7 multiplications instead of 8</strong>.</p>

<p>That reduced the complexity from <code>n³</code> to <code>n<sup>log₂7</sup> ≈ n<sup>2.8</sup></code>.</p>

<p>Further research (notably at IBM) pushed the exponent even lower to about <strong>2.376</strong>.</p>

<p>However, in practice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>These algorithms have <strong>large constants</strong> (C).</li>
    <li>They are <strong>hard to implement</strong>.</li>
    <li>They offer little advantage for typical problem sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, <strong>Gaussian Elimination</strong> remains the most practical and reliable method in real-world numerical computing.</p>
