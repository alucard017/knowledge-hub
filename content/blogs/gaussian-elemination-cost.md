## What is Gaussian Elimination?

Gaussian Elimination is a method used to solve systems of linear equations.
It systematically eliminates variables to reduce the system into an upper triangular form, followed by back substitution to find the unknowns.

Essentially, it answers:
👉 “How can we convert any system of equations into a simpler one that is easy to solve?”

## Why Analyze Its Cost?

When solving large systems (with n equations and n unknowns), we usually let computers perform the elimination.
But before running the algorithm, it is crucial to know how much computational effort it will take.

In Gaussian Elimination, the main question is:

“How many arithmetic operations (additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions) are needed?”
---

## Types of Operations

During elimination, two main types of operations occur:
1. **Division** → To find the multiplier λ (pivot ratio).
2. **Multiply–Subtract** → To eliminate elements below the pivot (each considered one operation).
So every time we zero out an element below the pivot, we perform a division and several multiply–subtracts.

## Step-by-Step Cost Analysis

Let’s analyze this column by column:
#### First Column
We eliminate elements below the first pivot.
There are **(n − 1) rows** below it.
For each row, roughly **n** operations are needed (to modify entries along that row).
So, **total ≈ n(n-1) = n<sup>2</sup> - n** operations

#### Next Columns

In the next steps, the system gets smaller:

When only k equations remain, the cost per stage is roughly **k<sup>2</sup> − k**.

To find the total cost, we sum all these over every stage:

∑

=
1
𝑛
(
𝑘

−
𝑘
)
k=1
∑

That’s O(n³) complexity.

👉 If you double the size (n → 2n), the cost increases roughly 8 times.

⚙️ Back-Substitution Cost

Once the matrix is in upper-triangular form:

The last variable needs 1 operation.

The second-last needs 2 operations, and so on.

That’s much faster — O(n²).

📏 Right-Hand Side (RHS) Operations

The right-hand side (the constants of each equation) also gets updated during elimination,
adding roughly:

𝑛

n
2

operations in total — still smaller than the cubic cost of elimination.

## Can It Be Faster?

Originally, mathematicians believed that no method could beat **𝑛<sup>3</sup>/3 operations**.
But **Strassen’s algorithm** surprised everyone by multiplying matrices using only **7 multiplications instead of 8**.

That reduced the complexity from 
𝑛<sup>log</sup>

.

Further research (notably at IBM) pushed the exponent even lower to about 2.376.

However, in practice:

These algorithms have large constants (C),

Are hard to code, and

Offer little advantage for typical problem sizes.

So, Gaussian Elimination remains the most practical and reliable method in real-world numerical computing.
